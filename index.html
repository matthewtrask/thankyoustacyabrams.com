        <h3 class="font-medium text-3xl pt-4">You absolute legend.</h3>
        <p class="font-medium text-1xl pt-4">You did the work no one else wanted to do. You did the work that was needed to be done. Because of you Georgia has flipped. Because of you Georgia has given us hope in a time where hope is hard to find.</p>
        <p class="font-medium text-1xl pt-4">800,000 people were registered because of you. And while this is an incredibly small token of thanks, your actions deserve the highest levels of recognition.</p>
        <h3 class="font-medium text-3xl pt-4">From the bottom of many hearts, thank you. Thank you so much.</h3>
